      "intro": "In painting, in drawing, as in clay, I start from a spontaneous mark and then, at my own pace, I set off on an Adventure.",
      "intuitive_work": "I work intuitively, without preconceived ideas or particular expectations. Only the desire, the pleasure of creating, and the acceptance of what is happening, in the present moment, matter to me.",
      "creative_process_title": "My Creative Process",
      "creative_process": "I play with shapes, colors, and materials on a variety of surfaces. I project, I move... I live my painting, I even dance to it sometimes! Calm times, more turbulent times, impulses, moments of pause... I try, I test, I explore the material, I question it, a dialogue develops between it and me, and the artwork takes shape. I accept working with who I am. Sometimes accidents happen, just like in life! It's always interesting to see what scars they leave and where the work will evolve. This adventure isn't always easy, and sometimes I come away shaken, but ultimately, always stronger. The more I manage to let go, the more I feel better, my self-esteem grows, and my creativity becomes more spontaneous.",
      "realization": "I realize after each new production, with a joy renewed each time, that I am capable of doing interesting things, which speak to me. A motivation which makes me thirst to continue again and again.",
      "evolution": "My personal development and that of my artistic work are linked and feed off each other, like a virtuous spiral.",
      "wellbeing": "Whatever the material I explore (oils, acrylics, charcoal, mixtures of materials, clay, ...), in silence or with music, what always predominates, when I am in full research and creativity, is this feeling of incredible well-being. I feel as if I am merging with my nascent work, I forget everything, I am in my bubble and when I reach the feeling of true freedom, when I manage to listen to myself and create by detaching myself from all external judgment, I feel that I am moving forward.",
      "emotional_expression": "I love what takes shape before my eyes. I love being surprised. Sometimes, a single mark of paint or a quick imprint in the earth is enough to make me feel good, and I leave it at that. Other times, the need to add, dig, wipe, strike, scratch, polish arises. It all depends on my emotional state at the time. The final result is always a way of expressing an emotion, a moment in life, a state of mind, but sometimes also a desire to convey a message.",
      "technique_philosophy": "Technique, materials, colors, tools... lead to nothing without the feelings, emotions and memories that impose themselves on the soul.",
      "benefits_title": "The Benefits of Creation",
      "benefits": "I feel a constant need to create, and these two mediums, painting and clay, allow me to experience this creative process intensely. It's an incredibly rich experience because creating allows me to: express myself, question myself, be moved, move, marvel, be astonished, surprise myself, release my emotions, free myself, let go, open myself up, touch, feel, simply feel good, just be where I belong, feel \"capable of\", feel alive!",
      "external_views": "To create freely, I've learned to detach myself from the opinions of others. With their own, often limiting, beliefs, they can be a hindrance to my creativity. To avoid this, I only welcome questions and constructive criticism, allowing me to move forward and evolve in my creative work. Only what is good for me matters. In any case, reality is simply a matter of perspective. To each their own point of view, to each their own reality. Ultimately, there is no right or wrong. The important thing is to allow yourself to create freely.",
      "dare": "To dare",
      "master_word": "It's overwhelming, energizing, motivating, transforming... My key word is \"dare\": dare to evolve at your own pace, dare to take a step back, dare to test, dare to accept the unpredictable, dare to innovate, dare to transform, dare to let go, dare to be yourself, Dare the Adventure!",

      "intro": "Born in 69, I spent my childhood in department 68 and my student life in department 67 (Strasbourg), then a stint in Lorraine in department 54, then 20 years in the Paris region, in Seine et Marne 77, before returning to Lorraine!",
      "characteristic": "My characteristic: \"My hand itches\"",
      "early_life_title": "My First Inspirations",
      "early_life": "Even as a child, I felt the need to draw, paint, and model clay, and I experienced immense pleasure and fulfillment in the act of creation. However, I put all of this aside for many years, believing that scientific studies would better prepare me for a career.",
      "scientific_career_title": "Scientific Journey",
      "scientific_career": "With a master's degree in biochemistry and plant physiology, I found myself working as an analyst-writer in the Biology section of the Ministry of Defense. A very interesting job, certainly, but after several years, I chose not to renew my contract to dedicate more time to my children, whom I saw far too little. Always full of ideas, I decided to change direction. Having already provided numerous tutoring sessions, homework help, and literacy classes in various settings throughout my university years, I opted for teaching. Another very interesting profession... Yet, while I always loved what I did, something essential was missing.",
      "artistic_discovery_title": "Decisive Encounter",
      "artistic_discovery": "At the end of 2006, I met a painter who used a technique that really resonated with me: oil glazing. I felt I had to learn this technique! So I enrolled in her workshop. I slowly reconnected with the canvas, the materials, the tools, and above all, with myself. Initially, I progressed by working with the group, whose energy and dynamism were truly inspiring.",
      "solo_journey_title": "Personal Exploration",
      "solo_journey": "In 2008, I felt the need to work alone. \"My hand was itching\" more and more: I became a researcher, an explorer of pictorial expression, and since then, I have never stopped painting, \"fusing\", testing new mixtures of materials on new supports, all with complete freedom and intuition. I became fully aware that this mode of expression suited me. It allowed me to release my emotions without seeking to have a particular representation of what I was going to produce beforehand, and to evolve on a personal level. I then decided to dedicate myself entirely to intuitive painting using mixed techniques.",
      "learning_title": "Training and Development",
      "learning": "I completed my exploration by working for 2 years with Alain Marie (Lésigny 77, in the Paris region). I particularly appreciate this painter's Work. He notably taught me how to integrate \"the piano\" and \"the forte\" into a painting, allowing the viewer's eye to wander freely. I also participated in life drawing sessions for several years, I wanted to learn to work for short periods, to get to the heart of the matter, or at least try! I attended various workshops (Watercolors with Catherine Mithouard in 2020 and Pascale Lelièvre in 2021, Acrylic Glazing with Fabienne Martin in 2020, Mixed Techniques with Marie-Hélène Lecuyer in 2016,...), but I continue to explore on my own! I love surprises! I always say, \"I don't go to the painting, it comes to me.\" Then, there was a back and forth between him and me, a real dialogue that developed.",
      "current_practice_title": "My Current Practice",
      "current_practice": "Today, I paint freely, without imitating or reproducing, I simply let it \"come out of me\": I create. Whether it's beautiful or not is irrelevant to me! I see, throughout my work, that there are very different periods (harsh expressions, soft atmospheres, vibrant colors, splashes, swirls,...). I accept each of these periods, the change happens naturally, without any constraint on my part, and I move forward in this way, constantly evolving in my painting and in my personal life, ever more motivated and confident.",
      "teaching_title": "Transmission and Sharing",
      "teaching": "Convinced that my experience was transferable, I began offering my services in different organizations. I was able to validate the relevance of this tool in a GRETA, Cultural Centers, and in a hospital setting. The feedback was very positive: a feeling of freedom, development of creativity, self-awareness, gain in self-confidence, a desire to dare more, to move forward, to surpass oneself. So many feelings that release an unsuspected energy and allow a better relationship with oneself and others.",
